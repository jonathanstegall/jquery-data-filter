jQuery Data Filter
==================

With this plugin, you can supply a selector that represents nearly any repetitive dataset - an ordered or 
unordered list, or a table with rows that follow a pattern, etc.

If the contents follow this pattern, you'll be able to filter the items by letter (in an A - Z list), number
(matching anything that starts with a numeric character), or search term (with a form that hides non-matches).
